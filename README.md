## Role: Data Analyst
This report summarizes my contributions to the USD Bill Classification project. My primary responsibility was to handle the data-related tasks to ensure the dataset was clean, organized, and ready for model training.

## Key Contributions
### Data Preparation: 
I created and ran the prepare_data.py script. This script was crucial for unzipping the raw dataset and organizing the images into a clean, class-based directory structure (data/processed/).

### Data Validation:
I ensured the prepared data was correct and in the right format for the machine learning model.
