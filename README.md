## Role: Lead Developer, UI/UX Developer
As the lead developer, I oversaw the project's overall structure and functionality. My main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface to make the AI model accessible to end-users.

## Key Contributions
### Project Setup:
I was responsible for the initial project setup, including creating the repository structure and setting up the UV environment.

### Project Lead:
I managed the project structure, ensuring all team members' work was integrated smoothly and that the final project met all requirements.

### User Interface (UI):
I built the app.py script to create a web-based interface using the Gradio library. This UI allows users to easily upload images of dollar bills and get instant predictions from our trained model.

### Code Integration:
I integrated the trained model into the UI and handled the logic to load the model and process user inputs.

### Final Documentation:
I was responsible for the final project documentation, including completing the main README.md and setting up the .python-version file to ensure a consistent environment for all team members.
