# Student 2: Musa Ali Al-Salmany
## Role: ML Engineer
My role in the USD Bill Classification project was to develop, train, and evaluate the core machine learning model. My work focused on creating a robust solution that could accurately classify different denominations of USD bills.

## Key Contributions
### Model Development: 
I designed and implemented the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Model Training: 
I developed and ran the train_model.py script to train the CNN on the prepared dataset. I also handled saving the trained model in the models/ directory.

## Performance Evaluation: 
I created the model_training_report.ipynb to analyze the model's performance, including its accuracy and key findings. I also wrote the docs/model_performance.md file to document the results.

## Testing and Validation: 
I created the test_project.py script to automatically validate that the data, model, and other project components were working correctly.
