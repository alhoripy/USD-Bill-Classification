## Model Details

* **Algorithm:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* **Framework:** TensorFlow and Keras
* **Architecture:** The model consists of three convolutional blocks (32, 64, and 128 filters), followed by a Flatten layer, a Dense layer, and a Dropout layer for regularization. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function to classify the images into one of seven denominations.
* **Input Size:** 150x150 pixels, 3 channels (RGB)
* **Training Parameters:**
    * **Epochs:** [10 epochs]
    * **Batch Size:** 1
    * **Optimizer:** Musa Ali 
    * **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy

## Performance Metrics

Based on the evaluation on the validation dataset, the model achieved the following performance:

* **Overall Accuracy:** [98.80]%
* **Overall Loss:** [0.0640]

The model's performance on a per-class basis can be visualized with the Confusion Matrix. 

### **Key Findings**

* **High Accuracy:** The CNN model demonstrates high overall accuracy in classifying different denominations of USD bills.
* **Strong Performance:** The model shows a robust ability to correctly identify most of the bills, with predictions clustered along the main diagonal of the confusion matrix.
* **Minimal Confusion:** Confusion between denominations is minimal, indicating that the model has learned the distinguishing features effectively. The most common misclassifications, if any, occurred between denominations that have similar color palettes or features.
* **Efficient Training:** The model converges quickly during training, achieving high accuracy in a relatively small number of epochs.

## Recommendations for Future Improvement

* **Data Augmentation:** Implement more advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., random rotation, zooming, lighting adjustments) to make the model more robust to real-world conditions.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, filter sizes, and learning rate, to optimize performance further.
* **Model Optimization:** Explore more advanced architectures like MobileNet or ResNet, which are pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for this specific task.
* **Edge Case Testing:** Collect additional data for any classes that show a higher number of misclassifications in the confusion matrix to improve performance on those specific denominations.
